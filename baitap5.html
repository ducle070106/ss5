    <h1>5. Groups of selectors</h1>
    <p>
      A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements
      selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is
      U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
      declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space
      may appear before and/or after the comma.

    <div class="block">
      <p>CSS example:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations
        into one. Thus,
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <p>h2 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <p>h3 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
      <br />
      <p>is equivalent to:</p>
      <br />
      <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
    </div>
  </body>
